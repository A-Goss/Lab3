# Everything about COD Zombies
Here I will explain about Call of duty zombies such as best maps and helpful things to know when playing.

## Things to know before playing

1.When playing Cod zombies I recommend only playing _Treyarch_ maps such as any BO3 or BO2 maps

2.**never play Vanguard Zombies since it was the worst edition to zombies** and best quoted by Dempsey himself about how we felt about this game and the next couple games coming out,>"I'm getting tired of this, you know you guys NEVER give the community what they want!"

3.Most maps they are easter eggs you can do and are worth doing for a reward

4.**If anything just have fun and play with friends**

Zombies is best played with friends but even when alone its fun to test yourself and do an easter egg by yourself or try to get a high round on a hard map.For best Maps in my opinion I believe Origins,Gorod Krovi and Buried are my favorites to go back and play. For the Worst maps in my opinion it would be almost any BO4 map or Vanguard Zombies like I said before.They just changed too much of the core fundamentals in zombies that the community liked and made them worse plus most maps are just remakes that were not very good.
